/**
 * Resolve the option written to Minecraft's `preferredGraphicsBackend` setting.
 *
 * `DEFAULT_OPENGL` normally respects a backend already saved by the game. Once the client
 * actually ships its Vulkan backend, however, that saved value can be a stale automatic Vulkan
 * choice from a previous failed launch. In that case the launcher's OpenGL default must win;
 * users who want to force Vulkan can still choose [GraphicsApi.VULKAN] explicitly.
 *
 * A null result means to preserve the existing option unchanged.
